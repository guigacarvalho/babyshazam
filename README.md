# BABY SHAZAM

## Description
This app aims to help desperate parents to understand their baby needs. 
The app works listening to baby cry for a short period of time and classifying that cry into:
- Hunger
- Pain
- Normal (Attention)
- Asphyxia
- Signs of Deafness

The classification uses the `Baby Chillanto collection of Infant Cry samples` and uses regular logistic regression to train and classify the cries.
